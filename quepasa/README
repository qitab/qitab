This is the initial working free release of Quepasa, a grammar based
parser/unparser that's convenient to use.  Thanks to ITA Software and
Google for releasing the code and to Far√© (fahree gmail com) for
getting it out.

There is a mailing list for this project at:

  http://common-lisp.net/projects/qitab/

On that page there is a link to the initial code release that this
code came from:

  http://common-lisp.net/project/qitab/archives/quux-2013-09-24.tar.bz2

To try Quepasa, fire up SBCL[1] and enter:

  (asdf:operate 'asdf:load-op 'quepasa :force T)
  (in-package QUEPASA)
  (run-quepasa-grammar-unit-tests :lambda-expression)


[1] Probably works on CMUCL too, at least it did at one time.
